# Python---Neural-Network-From-Scratch
## Overview
This project is a simple yet powerful demonstration of a neural network built entirely from scratch using Python and NumPy.

The core of this project is the implementation of a neural network without relying on deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Instead, NumPy is used to perform all the necessary matrix operations and backpropagation.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Numpy

## Result
The neural network achieves a competitive accuracy on the MNIST test set, demonstrating the power of building neural networks from scratch with just NumPy.
